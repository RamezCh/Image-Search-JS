# Image Search Application README

This is a simple Image Search Application that allows you to search for images using the Unsplash API. You can enter a search query, and the application will display a list of images related to your query. You can also load more images as you scroll down the results.

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, you'll need to obtain an API access key from Unsplash. Follow these steps:

Visit the Unsplash Developers website and create a developer account if you don't have one.

Once you're logged in, create a new application to get your API access keys. You will receive a client_id and a client_secret.

Open the index.html file and replace the placeholder yourAccessKey and yourSecretKey with the actual keys you obtained from Unsplash.

```javascript
const yourAccessKey = "YOUR_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY";
const yourSecretKey = "YOUR_UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY";
```

## How to Use
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Enter a search query in the input field and click the "Search" button or press Enter. This will fetch images related to your query from Unsplash and display them on the page.

As you scroll down, you can click the "Show More" button to load additional images.

## Application Structure
